# Android app for controlling the OpenAstroTracker
This is a basic app for just getting the mount polar aligned and ready to use, I made this to save me taking out a laptop that cannot handle the cold.

[OpenAstroTracker](https://github.com/OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroTracker)

## What works
- Bluetooth connection to OTA via ESP32
- Homing
- Position information
- Tracking control and status
- Slewing status
- Disconnection
- Messages to/from the mount
- Setting site information (Lat/Lon)
- Setting calibration fields (Speed factor, and steps/deg)
- Polar alignment

## What doesn't work (yet)
- Wifi/USB connections
- Manual slew movement (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- Slew to coordinates
- GPS location
